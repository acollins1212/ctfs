FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST

Dear Issi Narcho,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “rectum” we collected the following
information:
The rectum is the final straight portion of the large intestine in humans and some other
mammals, and the gut in others. The adult human rectum is about 12 centimetres (4.7
in) long, and begins at the rectosigmoid junction, the end of the sigmoid colon, at the level
of the third sacral vertebra or the sacral promontory depending upon what definition is
used. Its caliber is similar to that of the sigmoid colon at its commencement, but it is
dilated near its termination, forming the rectal ampulla. It terminates at the level of the
anorectal ring (the level of the puborectalis sling) or the dentate line, again depending
upon which definition is used. In humans, the rectum is followed by the anal canal, before
the gastrointestinal tract terminates at the anal verge. The word rectum comes from the
Latin rectum intestinum, meaning straight intestine.
Sincerely,

John Smith
FOI Manager

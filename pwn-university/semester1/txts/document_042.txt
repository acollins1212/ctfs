FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST

Dear Sonni Erasmus,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “octopussy” we collected the following information:
Octopussy is a 1983 British spy film, the thirteenth in the James Bond series produced by
Eon Productions, and the sixth to star Roger Moore as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond.
The film’s title is taken from a short story in Ian Fleming’s 1966 short story collection
Octopussy and The Living Daylights, although the film’s plot is original. It does, however,
include a scene inspired by the Fleming short story "The Property of a Lady" (included in
1967 and later editions of Octopussy and The Living Daylights), while the events of the
short story "Octopussy" form a part of the title character’s background and are recounted
by her. Bond is assigned the task of following a general who is stealing jewels and relics
from the Soviet government. This leads him to a wealthy Afghan prince, Kamal Khan,
and his associate, Octopussy, and the discovery of a plot to force disarmament in Western
Europe with the use of a nuclear weapon. Octopussy was produced by Albert R. Broccoli
and Michael G. Wilson, and was released in the same year as the non-Eon Bond film Never
Say Never Again. The film was written by George MacDonald Fraser, Richard Maibaum,
and Michael G. Wilson, and was directed by John Glen.
Sincerely,

John Smith

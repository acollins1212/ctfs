FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST

Dear Eddi Evelina,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “beaner” we collected the following
information:
Beaner is derogatory slang for Mexicans or people of Mexican descent. The term originates from the prevalence of pinto beans and other beans in Mexican cuisine.According
to The Historical Dictionary of American Slang, the word was first seen in print in 1965,
although the term has reportedly been in use at least since the 1940s (perhaps having
evolved from previous slurs such as "bean-eater" and "bean-bandit" that were in use since
as far back as the 1910s.)It appears that the term may be going through a phase of melioration, where the negative connotation of an ethnic slur is "reclaimed" by those against
whom it is directed and used in a neutral or even positive manner.
Sincerely,

John Smith
FOI Manager

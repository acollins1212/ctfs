FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST

Dear Halley Iphigeniah,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “threesome” we collected the following information:
In human sexuality, a threesome is sexual activity that involves three people at the same
time. Threesome can also refer to a love triangle, a three-way romantic relationship.
Though threesome is most commonly applied to a casual sexual activity involving sexual
activity among three participants, a threesome may also be found in a long-term domestic
relationship, such as polyamory or a ménage à trois. A threesome is a form of group
sex, but involving only three people. It may occur more frequently in private situations,
such as spontaneous sexual activity among three friends, or arranged in a community
of like-minded swingers or planned as a once-only experience; and rarely in anonymous
settings, such as at orgies or other sex parties. Among swinging couples, one of the two
partners is often the driving force and the other is more passive-supportive of the addition
of additional sex parties. Some couples use a threesome as a way to develop a love triangle
(ménage à trois). A threesome is a common element of sexual fantasy. It is commonly
depicted in pornography, but very rarely in mainstream cinema.
Sincerely,

John Smith

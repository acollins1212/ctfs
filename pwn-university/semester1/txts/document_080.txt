Dear Lisetta Paluas,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “footjob” we collected the following
information:
A footjob is a non-penetrative sexual practice with the feet that involves one’s feet being
rubbed on a partner in order to induce sexual excitement, stimulation or orgasm. In some
cases it can be part of a foot fetish. Footjobs are most often performed on males, with one
partner using their feet or toes to stroke or rub the other partner’s genital area. Footjob
may also refer to the practice of using one’s feet or toes to caress a female partner’s breasts
or vulva.
Sincerely,

John Smith
FOI Manager

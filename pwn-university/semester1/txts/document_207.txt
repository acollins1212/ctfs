Dear Lesley Leach,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “negro” we collected the following
information:
Negro (plural Negroes) is an archaic term traditionally used to denote persons considered
to be of Negroid heritage. The term can be construed as offensive, inoffensive or completely neutral, largely depending on the region where it is used. It has various equivalents in other European languages.
Sincerely,

John Smith
FOI Manager

Dear Marguerite Roye,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “fisting” we collected the following
information:
Fisting, handballing, fist-fucking, brachiovaginal, or brachioproctic insertion is a sexual
activity that involves inserting a hand into the vagina or rectum. Once insertion is complete, the fingers are either clenched into a fist or kept straight. Fisting may be performed
without a partner, but it is most often a partnered activity.
Sincerely,

John Smith
FOI Manager

FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST

Dear Delinda Trenton,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “bollocks” we collected the following
information:
"Bollocks" is a word of Middle English origin, meaning "testicles". The word is often
used figuratively in colloquial British English and Hiberno-English as a noun to mean
"nonsense", an expletive following a minor accident or misfortune, or an adjective to mean
"poor quality" or "useless". Similarly, common phrases like "Bollocks to this!" and "That’s
a load of old bollocks" generally indicate contempt for a certain task, subject or opinion.
Conversely, the word also figures in idiomatic phrases such as "the dog’s bollocks" or more
simply "the bollocks" (as opposed to just "bollocks"), which will refer to something which
is admired, approved of or well-respected.
Sincerely,

John Smith
FOI Manager

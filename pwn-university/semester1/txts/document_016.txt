FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST

Dear Briny Whang,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “orgy” we collected the following
information:
In modern usage, an orgy is a sex party where guests freely engage in open and unrestrained sexual activity or group sex. Swingers’ parties do not always conform to this designation because at many swinger parties the sexual partners may all know each other or
at least have some commonality among economic class, educational attainment or other
shared attributes. Some swingers contend that an orgy, as opposed to a sex party, requires some anonymity of sexual partners in complete sexual abandon. Other kinds of
"sex party" may fare less well with this labeling. Participation in an "orgy" is a common
sexual fantasy and group sex targeting such consumers is a subgenre in pornographic
films. The term is also used metaphorically in expressions, such as an "orgy of colour"
or an "orgy of destruction" to indicate excess, overabundance. The term "orgiastic" does
not generally connote group sex and is closer to the classical roots and this metaphorical
usage.
Sincerely,

John Smith

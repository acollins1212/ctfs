FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST

Dear Karlotta Shimkus,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “gang bang” we collected the following information:
A gang bang is a situation in which several people engage in physical sexual activity with
one specific individual sequentially or at the same time. That specific individual is the
central focus of the sexual activity; for example, it could be one woman surrounded by
several men or a man with multiple women. Rather than serial couplings by two people,
the gang bang is defined by the number and simultaneity of the various sex acts, such as
vaginal, anal or oral sex or double penetration or triple penetration.
Sincerely,

John Smith
FOI Manager

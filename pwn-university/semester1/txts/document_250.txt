FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST

Dear Gayel Ardeha,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “bunghole” we collected the following information:
A bunghole or bungehole is a hole bored in a liquid-tight barrel to remove contents. The
hole is capped with a large cork-like object called a bung. Acceptable usage include other
access points that may be capped with alternate materials providing an air- or water-tight
access to other vessels. For example, a bunghole on a combustion chamber can be used
to remove slag or add coal. Bungholes can also be utilized to insert and remove sensing
probes or equipment like mixers to agitate the contents within a vessel. Bungholes were
first used on wooden barrels, and were typically bored by the purchaser of the barrel
using a brace and bit. Bungholes can be bored in either head (end) of a barrel or in one
of the staves (side). With the bung removed, a tapered faucet can be attached to aid
with dispensing. When barrels full of a commodity were shipped, the recipient would
often bore new bungholes of the most suitable size and placement rather than remove the
existing bung. Wooden barrels manufactured by specialty firms today usually are bored
by the maker with suitable bungholes, since the hobbyists who purchase them for the
making of beer, wine, and fermented foods often do not have a suitable brace and bit.
Closed-head steel barrels and drums now used for shipment of chemicals and petroleum
products have a standardized bunghole arrangement, with one 2 inch NPT and one 3/4
inch NPT threaded bunghole on opposite sides of the top head. Some steel barrels are also
equipped with a 2-inch threaded bunghole on the side.
Sincerely,

John Smith

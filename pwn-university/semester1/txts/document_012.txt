Dear Novelia Gonyea,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “camel toe” we collected the following information:
Camel toe, or cameltoe, is slang for the outline of a woman’s labia majora in tightly fitting
clothes. Owing to a combination of anatomical factors and the tightness of the fabric
covering the area, the crotch and mons pubis may display a shape resembling the forefoot
of a camel. Camel toe commonly occurs as a result of wearing tight-fitting clothes, such
as shorts, hotpants or swimwear.
Sincerely,

John Smith
FOI Manager

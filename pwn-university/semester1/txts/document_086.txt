FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST

Dear Georgine Feinleib,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “nigger” we collected the following
information:
In the English language, the word nigger is a racial slur typically directed at black people. The word originated as a variation of the Spanish and Portuguese noun negro, a
descendant of the Latin adjective niger ("black"). It was often used derogatorily, and by
the mid-twentieth century, particularly in the United States, its usage became unambiguously pejorative, a racist insult. Accordingly, it began to disappear from popular culture,
and its continued inclusion in classic works of literature has sparked controversy. Because
the term is considered extremely offensive, it is often replaced with the euphemism "the
N-word".
Sincerely,

John Smith
FOI Manager

Dear Jobi Ark,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “cornhole” we collected the following
information:
Cornhole or bean bag toss (also known regionally as baggo, bags, sack toss, or bean sack)
is a lawn game in which players take turns throwing bags of corn (or bean bags) at a
raised platform with a hole in the far end. A bag in the hole scores 3 points, while one on
the platform scores 1 point. Play continues until a team or player reaches (or exceeds) the
score of 21.
Sincerely,

John Smith
FOI Manager

FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST

Dear Charlean Elston,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “motherfucker” we collected the
following information:
Motherfucker (sometimes abbreviated as mofo, mf, or mf ’er) is an English-language vulgarism. While the word is usually considered highly offensive, it is rarely used in the
literal sense of one who engages in sexual activity with another person’s mother, or his or
her own mother. Rather, it refers to a mean, despicable, or vicious person, or any particularly difficult or frustrating situation. Alternatively, it can be a term of admiration, as in
the phrase "bad ass motherfucker", meaning a fearless and confident person.
Sincerely,

John Smith
FOI Manager

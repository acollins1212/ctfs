FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST

Dear Janifer Yelich,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “dominatrix” we collected the following information:
A dominatrix (), plural dominatrixes or dominatrices (), is a woman who takes the dominant role in BDSM activities. A dominatrix might be of any sexual orientation, but her
orientation does not necessarily limit the genders of her submissive partners. The role
of a dominatrix may not even involve physical pain toward the submissive; her domination can be verbal, involving humiliating tasks, or servitude. A dominatrix is typically
a paid professional (pro-domme) as the term dominatrix is little-used within the nonprofessional BDSM scene. The term domme is a coined pseudo-French female variation
of the slang dom (short for dominant). The use of domme, dominatrix, dom, or dominant
by any woman in a dominant role is chosen mostly by personal preference and the conventions of the local BDSM scene. The term mistress or dominant mistress is sometimes
also used. Female dominance, female domination or femdom refer to BDSM relationships
and BDSM scenes in which the dominant partner is female. As fetish culture is increasingly becoming more prevalent in Western media, depictions of dominatrices in film and
television have become more common.
Sincerely,

John Smith

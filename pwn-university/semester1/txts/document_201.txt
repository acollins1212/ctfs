Dear Laurel Cyrillus,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “upskirt” we collected the following
information:
Upskirt is the practice of making unauthorized photographs under a woman’s skirt, capturing an image of her crotch area, underwear and sometimes genitalia. The term "upskirt" can also refer to a photograph, video, or illustration which incorporates an upskirt
image. The practice is regarded as a form of sexual fetishism or voyeurism and is similar
in nature to downblouse. The ethical and legal issue relating to upskirt and downblouse
photography is one of a reasonable expectation of privacy, even in a public place.
Sincerely,

John Smith
FOI Manager

FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST

Dear Luelle Rumney,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “doggy style” we collected the following information:
Doggy style, also spelled doggie style, is a sex position in which a person bends over,
crouches on all fours (usually on hands and knees), or lies on their abdomen, for sexual
intercourse, other forms of sexual penetration or other sexual activity. Doggy style sex
is a form of a rear-entry position, others being with the receiving partner lying on the
side in the spoons sex position or the reverse cowgirl sex position. Non-penetrative sex in
this position may also be regarded as doggy style sex. Between sex partners, the person
in the doggy style position is passive, while the other partner is active. Either partner
may be the dominant partner or the submissive partner. The passive partner is open to
a variety of sexual activities, with the active partner being able to penetrate the vagina,
the anus during anal sex, or being in a position to perform oral sex (cunnilingus, fellatio
or anilingus).
Sincerely,

John Smith
FOI Manager

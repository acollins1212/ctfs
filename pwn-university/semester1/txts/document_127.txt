FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST

Dear Coral Tomi,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “clitoris” we collected the following
information:
The clitoris ( ( listen) or ( listen)) is a female sex organ present in mammals, ostriches
and a limited number of other animals. In humans, the visible button-like portion is near
the front junction of the labia minora (inner lips), above the opening of the urethra. Unlike the penis, the male homologue (equivalent) to the clitoris, it usually does not contain
the distal portion (or opening) of the urethra and is therefore not used for urination. It
also usually lacks a reproductive function. While few animals urinate through the clitoris or use it reproductively, the spotted hyena, which has an especially large clitoris,
urinates, mates and gives birth via the organ. Some other mammals, such as lemurs
and spider monkeys, also have a large clitoris. The clitoris is the human female’s most
sensitive erogenous zone and generally the primary anatomical source of human female
sexual pleasure. In humans and other mammals, it develops from an outgrowth in the
embryo called the genital tubercle. Initially undifferentiated, the tubercle develops into
either a penis or a clitoris, depending on the presence or absence of the protein tdf, which
is codified by a single gene on the Y chromosome. The clitoris is a complex structure, and
its size and sensitivity can vary. The glans (head) of the human clitoris is roughly the size
and shape of a pea, and is estimated to have about 8,000 sensory nerve endings. Sexological and medical debate have focused on the clitoris, and it has also been the subject
of sociological (including social constructionist) analyses and studies. Such discussions
range from anatomical accuracy, gender inequality, orgasmic factors and their physiological explanation for the G-spot. Although, in humans, the only known purpose of the
clitoris is to provide sexual pleasure, whether the clitoris is vestigial, an adaptation, or
serves a reproductive function has been debated. Social perceptions of the clitoris include
the significance of its role in female sexual pleasure, assumptions about its true size and
depth, and varying beliefs regarding genital modification such as clitoris enlargement,
clitoris piercing and clitoridectomy. Genital modification may be for aesthetic, medical or
cultural reasons. Knowledge of the clitoris is significantly impacted by cultural perceptions of the organ. Studies suggest that knowledge of its existence and anatomy is scant
in comparison with that of other sexual organs, and that more education about it could
help alleviate social stigmas associated with the female body and female sexual pleasure;
for example, that the clitoris and vulva in general are visually unappealing, that female
masturbation is taboo, or that men should be expected to master and control women’s

orgasms.
Sincerely,

John Smith

FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST

Dear Letti Rosalyn,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “zoophilia” we collected the following information:
Zoophilia is a paraphilia involving a sexual fixation on non-human animals. Bestiality
is cross-species sexual activity between human and non-human animals. The terms are
often used interchangeably, but some researchers make a distinction between the attraction (zoophilia) and the act (bestiality). Although sex with animals is not outlawed in
some countries, in most countries, bestiality is illegal under animal abuse laws or laws
dealing with buggery or crimes against nature.
Sincerely,

John Smith
FOI Manager

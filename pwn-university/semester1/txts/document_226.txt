FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST

Dear Rosalia Tana,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “panties” we collected the following
information:
Panties in American English (typically called knickers in British English) are a form of
underwear worn by women. Panties are most often form-fitting, but may also be loose.
Typical components include an elastic waistband, a crotch panel to cover the genital area
(usually lined with absorbent material such as cotton), and a pair of leg openings that,
like the waistband, are often made of elastic. Various materials are used, but are usually
chosen to be breathable. Panties were originally designed to cover the entire lower half of
the female torso, since the 1970s panties have had either no legs or, in some cases, very
short ones, and have become increasingly brief over time.
Sincerely,

John Smith
FOI Manager

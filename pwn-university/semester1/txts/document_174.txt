FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST

Dear Janeva Gen,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “cunnilingus” we collected the following information:
Cunnilingus is an oral sex act performed by a person on a female’s genitalia (the clitoris,
other parts of the vulva or the vagina). The clitoris is the most sexually sensitive part of
the human female genitalia, and its stimulation may result in female sexual arousal or
orgasm. Cunnilingus can be sexually arousing for participants and may be performed by
a sexual partner as foreplay to incite sexual arousal before other sexual activities (such
as vaginal or anal intercourse) or as an erotic and physically intimate act on its own. Like
most forms of sexual activity, oral sex can be a risk for contracting sexually transmitted
infections (STIs/STDs). However, the transmission risk for oral sex, especially HIV transmission, is significantly lower than for vaginal or anal sex. Oral sex is often regarded as
taboo, but most countries do not have laws which ban the practice. Commonly, heterosexual couples do not regard cunnilingus as affecting the virginity of either partner, while
lesbian couples commonly do regard it as a form of virginity loss. People may also have
negative feelings or sexual inhibitions about giving or receiving cunnilingus or may refuse
to engage in it.
Sincerely,

John Smith
FOI Manager

Dear Ardisj Thomasina,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “sodomy” we collected the following
information:
Sodomy () is generally anal or oral sex between people or sexual activity between a person
and a non-human animal (bestiality), but it may also mean any non-procreative sexual
activity. Originally, the term sodomy, which is derived from the story of Sodom and Gomorrah in the Book of Genesis, was commonly restricted to anal sex. Sodomy laws in
many countries criminalized the aforementioned behaviors. In the Western world, many
of these laws have been overturned or are not routinely enforced.
Sincerely,

John Smith
FOI Manager

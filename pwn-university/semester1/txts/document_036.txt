FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST

Dear Ollie Endres,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “g-spot” we collected the following
information:
The G-spot, also called the Gräfenberg spot (for German gynecologist Ernst Gräfenberg),
is characterized as an erogenous area of the vagina that, when stimulated, may lead to
strong sexual arousal, powerful orgasms and potential female ejaculation. It is typically
reported to be located 5–8 cm (2–3 in) up the front (anterior) vaginal wall between the
vaginal opening and the urethra and is a sensitive area that may be part of the female
prostate. The existence of the G-spot has not been proven, nor has the source of female
ejaculation. Although the G-spot has been studied since the 1940s, disagreement persists over its existence as a distinct structure, definition and location. A 2009 British
study concluded that its existence is unproven and subjective, based on questionnaires
and personal experience. Other studies, using ultrasound, have found physiological evidence of the G-spot in women who report having orgasms during vaginal intercourse. It
is also hypothesized that the G-spot is an extension of the clitoris and that this is the
cause of orgasms experienced vaginally. Sexologists and other researchers are concerned
that women may consider themselves to be dysfunctional if they do not experience G-spot
stimulation, and emphasize that this is not abnormal.
Sincerely,

John Smith

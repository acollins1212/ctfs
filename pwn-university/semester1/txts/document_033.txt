FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST

Dear Rea Ogilvy,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “pedobear” we collected the following information:
Pedobear is an Internet meme that became popular through the imageboard 4chan. As the
name suggests ("pedo" being short for "pedophile"), it is portrayed as a pedophilic cartoon
bear. It is a concept used to mock pedophiles or people who have any sexual interest in
children or "jailbait." The bear image has been likened to bait used to lure children or as
a mascot for pedophiles.
Sincerely,

John Smith
FOI Manager

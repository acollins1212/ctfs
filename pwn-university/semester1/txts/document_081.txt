Dear Dianna Mateya,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “nigga” we collected the following
information:
Nigga () is a colloquial term used in African American Vernacular English that began
as an eye dialect form of the word nigger, an ethnic slur against black people. In some
dialects of English, the word is pronounced the same as nigger in non-rhotic speech.
Sincerely,

John Smith
FOI Manager

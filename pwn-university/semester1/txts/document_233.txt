FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST

Dear Kori Saks,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “slut” we collected the following
information:
Slut is generally a term for a woman or girl who is considered to have loose sexual morals
or who is sexually promiscuous. It is usually used as an insult, sexual slur or offensive
term of disparagement (slut shaming). It originally meant "a dirty, slovenly woman", and
is rarely used to refer to men, generally requiring clarification by use of the terms male
slut or man whore. The first recorded use of the word was in Geoffrey Chaucer’s The
Canterbury Tales. Chaucer wrote, "Why is thy lord so sluttish, I thee pray, And is of
power better clothes to bey." He is referring to the man’s untidy appearance. There have
been attempts to reclaim the word for girls and women, and some individuals embrace the
title as a source of pride. A chiefly British variant of slut is slag, and a primarily North
American one is skank; both also imply low social class.
Sincerely,

John Smith
FOI Manager

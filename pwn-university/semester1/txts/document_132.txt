FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST

Dear Silvana Fonsie,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “anus” we collected the following
information:
The anus (from Latin anus meaning "ring", "circle") is an opening at the opposite end
of an animal’s digestive tract from the mouth. Its function is to control the expulsion of
feces, unwanted semi-solid matter produced during digestion, which, depending on the
type of animal, may include: matter which the animal cannot digest, such as bones; food
material after all the nutrients have been extracted, for example cellulose or lignin; ingested matter which would be toxic if it remained in the digestive tract; and dead or
excess gut bacteria and other endosymbionts. Amphibians, reptiles, and birds use the
same orifice (known as the cloaca) for excreting liquid and solid wastes, for copulation
and egg-laying. Monotreme mammals also have a cloaca, which is thought to be a feature
inherited from the earliest amniotes via the therapsids. Marsupials have a single orifice
for excreting both solids and liquids and, in females, a separate vagina for reproduction.
Female placental mammals have completely separate orifices for defecation, urination,
and reproduction; males have one opening for defecation and another for both urination
and reproduction, although the channels flowing to that orifice are almost completely
separate. The development of the anus was an important stage in the evolution of multicellular animals. It appears to have happened at least twice, following different paths
in protostomes and deuterostomes. This accompanied or facilitated other important evolutionary developments: the bilaterian body plan, the coelom, and metamerism, in which
the body was built of repeated "modules" which could later specialize, such as the heads
of most arthropods, which are composed of fused, specialized segments.
Sincerely,

John Smith

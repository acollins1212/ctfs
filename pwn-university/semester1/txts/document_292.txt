FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST

Dear Angelika Flita,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “rusty trombone” we collected the
following information:
Rusty trombone is an act in which a man stands with his knees and back slightly torqued
with feet at least shoulder width apart to expose his anus. The "player" typically kneels
behind the man and performs anilingus while reaching up beneath the testicles or around
the body to manually administer rapid up and down motions of the penis, mimicking the
motions of a trombone player. The act is defined primarily by the physical orientation
of the partners, the combination of anilingus with manual sexual stimulation and the
resemblance of the anal sphincter to a trombone mouthpiece; however, other positions
and variations are possible.
Sincerely,

John Smith
FOI Manager

FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST

Dear Eunice Toddy,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “jailbait” we collected the following
information:
Jailbait or jail bait is slang for a person who is younger than the legal age of consent
for sexual activity, with the implication that a person above the age of consent might
find them sexually attractive. The term jailbait is derived from the fact that engaging
in sexual activity with someone who is under the age of consent is classified as statutory
rape or by an equivalent term. The minor deemed sexually attractive is thus a temptation
to an older person to pursue them for sexual relations at the risk of being sent to jail if
caught.
Sincerely,

John Smith
FOI Manager

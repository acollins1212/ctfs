FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST

Dear Kate Hogan,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “group sex” we collected the following information:
Group sex is sexual behavior involving more than two participants. Group sex can occur
between people of all sexual orientations and genders. Group sex also occurs in populations of non-human animals such as bonobo apes and chimpanzees. Group sex most
commonly takes place in a private sex party or semi-public swinger gathering, but may
also take place at massage parlors or brothels or, in some jurisdictions, at purpose-built locations such as sex clubs. In places where non-monogamous sex is taboo or illegal, group
sex may take place in private or clandestine locations including homes, hotel rooms, or
private clubs. Fantasies of group sex are extremely common among both men and women,
and group sex is a subgenre in pornographic films.
Sincerely,

John Smith
FOI Manager

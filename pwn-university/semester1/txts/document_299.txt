Dear Hyacinthia Lenee,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “fuck” we collected the following
information:
Fuck is an obscene English-language word, which often refers to the act of sexual intercourse but is also commonly used as an intensifier or to denote disdain. Its origin is
obscure but is usually considered to be first attested to around 1475, although it may be
considerably older. In modern usage, the term "fuck" and its derivatives (such as "fucker"
and "fucking") can be used as a noun, a verb, an adjective, an interjection, or an adverb.
There are many common phrases that employ the word, as well as compounds that incorporate it, such as "motherfucker," "fuckwit" and "fucknut".
Sincerely,

John Smith
FOI Manager

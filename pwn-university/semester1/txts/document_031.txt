Dear Courtenay Saphra,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “twat” we collected the following
information:
The word twat is widely used as a derogatory epithet, especially in British English, referring to a person considered obnoxious or stupid. It is also used informally as a verb
in British English to mean "to hit or punch a person". In British English and Commonwealth English, it is pronounced to rhyme with that, or sometimes , to rhyme with hot.
In North American English, it is pronounced , to rhyme with squat. Twat is also used in
British English as vulgar slang for the vulva or female genitals in general.
Sincerely,

John Smith

FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST

Dear Chanda Rugen,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “ejaculation” we collected the following information:
Ejaculation is the discharge of semen (normally containing sperm) from the male reproductory tract, usually accompanied by orgasm. It is the final stage and natural objective of
male sexual stimulation, and an essential component of natural conception. In rare cases,
ejaculation occurs because of prostatic disease. Ejaculation may also occur spontaneously
during sleep (a nocturnal emission or "wet dream"). Anejaculation is the condition of being unable to ejaculate. Dysejaculation is an ejaculation that is painful or uncomfortable.
Retrograde ejaculation is the condition where semen travels backwards into the bladder
rather than out the urethra.
Sincerely,

John Smith
FOI Manager

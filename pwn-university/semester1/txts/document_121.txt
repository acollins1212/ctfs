FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST

Dear Andromache Docila,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “shemale” we collected the following
information:
Shemale (also known as she-male) is a term primarily used in sex work to describe a
transgender woman with male genitalia and female secondary sex characteristics, usually
including breasts from breast augmentation or use of hormones. Many transgender people
regard the term shemale as offensive, arguing that it mocks or shows a lack of respect
towards transgender individuals; in this view, the term emphasizes the natal sex of a
person and neglects their gender identity. Using the term shemale for a transsexual
woman often implies that she is working in the sex trade. The phrase is commonly used
in pornography. The term shemale has been used since the mid-19th century, when it was
a humorous colloquialism for female, especially an aggressive woman.
Sincerely,

John Smith
FOI Manager

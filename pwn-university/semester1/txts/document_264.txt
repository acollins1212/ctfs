FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST

Dear Libbie Rolfston,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “date rape” we collected the following information:
Date rape is a form of acquaintance rape. The two phrases are often used interchangeably,
but date rape specifically refers to a rape in which there has been some sort of romantic or
potentially sexual relationship between the two parties. Acquaintance rape also includes
rapes in which the victim and perpetrator have been in a non-romantic, non-sexual relationship, for example as co-workers or neighbors. Date rape is particularly prevalent on
college campuses, where it frequently occurs in situations involving alcohol or other date
rape drugs, which may facilitate the execution of drug-facilitated sexual assault (DFSA).
Sincerely,

John Smith
FOI Manager

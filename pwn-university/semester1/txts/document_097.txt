FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST

Dear Tim Eudocia,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “donkey punch” we collected the
following information:
Donkey punch is a slang term for the fictitious sexual practice of inflicting blunt force
trauma to the back of the head or lower back of the receiving partner during anal or
vaginal sex as an attempt by the penetrating partner to induce involuntary tightening of
internal or external anal sphincter muscles or vaginal passage of the receiving partner.
According to Dr. Jeffrey Bahr of Medical College of Wisconsin there is no reflex in humans
that would cause such tensing in response to a blow on the head, although striking a
partner on the back of the neck or head could cause severe, even lethal injury.
Sincerely,

John Smith
FOI Manager

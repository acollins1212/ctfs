via the FOI website
Dear Rosaleen Cathyleen,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “asshole” we collected the following
information:
The word asshole (in North American English) or arsehole (in all other major varieties of
the English language), is a vulgarism to describe the anus, and often used pejoratively (as
a type of synecdoche) to refer to people.
Sincerely,

John Smith
FOI Manager

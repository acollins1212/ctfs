FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST

Dear Hermina Jann,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “handjob” we collected the following
information:
A handjob is the manual stimulation of a male’s penis or scrotum by another person to
induce sexual pleasure, sometimes resulting in orgasm. The manual stimulation of a female’s vagina, clitoris or rest of the vulva is fingering, while the manual stimulation of the
genitals performed between two people is mutual masturbation. For circumcised males,
lubrication is commonly used, while in uncircumcised males, a handjob is performed by
moving the foreskin back and forth.
Sincerely,

John Smith
FOI Manager

Dear Page Albertina,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “shit” we collected the following
information:
Shit is a word considered vulgar and profane in Modern English. As a noun, it refers
to fecal matter, and as a verb it means to defecate; in the plural ("the shits"), it means
diarrhoea. Shite is a common variant in British and Irish English. As a slang term, it
has many meanings, including: nonsense, foolishness, something of little value or quality,
trivial and usually boastful or inaccurate talk or a contemptible person. It could also be
used to refer to any other noun in general or as an expression of annoyance, surprise or
anger.
Sincerely,

John Smith

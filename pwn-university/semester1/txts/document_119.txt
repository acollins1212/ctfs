FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST

Dear Georgianna Minsk,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “fellatio” we collected the following
information:
Fellatio (also known as fellation, and in slang as blowjob, BJ, giving head, or sucking off)
is an oral sex act involving the use of the mouth or throat, which is usually performed
by a person on the penis of another person. If performed on oneself, the act is called autofellatio. Oral stimulation of the scrotum may also be termed fellatio, or colloquially as
teabagging. Fellatio can be sexually arousing for both participants, and may lead to orgasm for the receiving partner. It may be performed by a sexual partner as foreplay before
other sexual activities (such as vaginal or anal intercourse), or as an erotic and physically
intimate act in its own right. Like most forms of sexual activity, oral sex creates a risk
of contracting sexually transmitted infections (STIs/STDs). However, the transmission
risk for oral sex, especially HIV transmission, is significantly lower than for vaginal or
anal sex. Most countries do not have laws that ban the practice of oral sex, though some
cultures may consider it taboo. People may also have negative feelings or sexual inhibitions about giving or receiving oral sex; they may refuse to engage in it of their own
volition. Commonly, people do not regard forms of oral sex as affecting the virginity of
either partner, though opinions on the matter vary.
Sincerely,

John Smith
FOI Manager

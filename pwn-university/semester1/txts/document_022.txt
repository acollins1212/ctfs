FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST

Dear Elianora Baird,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “pussy” we collected the following
information:
Pussy is a noun, an adjective, and in rare uses a verb in the English language. It has several meanings, including use as slang, as euphemism, and as vulgarity. Common meanings of the noun include "cat", as well as "coward or weakling", and "the human vulva or
vagina", or as a synecdoche, "sexual intercourse with a woman". Because of its multiple
senses including both innocent and vulgar connotations, "pussy" is often the subject of
double entendre. The etymology of the word is not entirely clear. Several different senses
of the word have different histories or origins.
Sincerely,

John Smith
FOI Manager

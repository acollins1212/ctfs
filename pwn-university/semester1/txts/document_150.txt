Dear Erina Ier,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “strip club” we collected the following information:
Strip clubs are venues where strippers provide adult entertainment, predominantly in the
form of striptease or other erotic or exotic dances. Strip clubs typically adopt a nightclub
or bar style, and can also adopt a theatre or cabaret-style. American-style strip clubs began to appear outside North America after World War II, arriving in Asia in the late 1940s
and Europe in the 1950s, where they competed against the local English and French styles
of striptease and erotic performances. As of 2005, the size of the global strip club industry
was estimated to be US75bill ion.I n2002, thesizeo f theU.S.stri pclubindustr ywasestimatedtobeU S3.1
billion, generating 19The strip club as an outlet for salacious entertainment is a recurrent
theme in popular culture. In some media, these clubs are portrayed primarily as gathering places of vice and ill repute. Clubs themselves and various aspects of the business are
highlighted in these references. "Top Strip Club" lists in some media have demonstrated
that U.S.-style striptease is a global phenomenon and that it has also become a culturally
accepted form of entertainment, despite its scrutiny in legal circles and popular media.
Popular Internet sites for strip club enthusiasts also have lists calculated from the inputs
of site visitors. The legal status of strip clubs has evolved over the course of time, with national and local laws becoming progressively more liberal on the issue around the world,
although some countries (such as Iceland) have implemented strict limits and bans. Strip
clubs are frequent targets of litigation around the world, and the sex industry, which includes strip clubs, is a hot button issue in popular culture and politics. Some clubs have
been linked to organized crime.
Sincerely,

FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST

Dear Myrilla Audwen,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “nipple” we collected the following
information:
The nipple is a raised region of tissue on the surface of the breast from which milk leaves
the breast through the lactiferous ducts. The milk can flow through the nipple passively
or it can be ejected by smooth muscle contractions that occur along the ductal system. The
nipple is surrounded by the areola which is often a darker color than the surrounding skin.
It is often called a teat when referring to non-humans. Teat can also be used to describe
the flexible mouthpiece of a baby bottle. In humans, nipples of both males and females
can be stimulated as part of sexual arousal. In many cultures, human female nipples
are sexualized, or "...regarded as sex objects and evaluated in terms of their physical
characteristics and sexiness."
Sincerely,

John Smith
FOI Manager

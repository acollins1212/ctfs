Dear Valeda Raul,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “doggystyle” we collected the following information:
Doggystyle is the debut studio album by American rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg. It was
released on November 23, 1993, by Death Row Records and Interscope Records. The
album was recorded and produced following Snoop’s appearances on Dr. Dre’s debut solo
album The Chronic (1992), to which Snoop contributed significantly. The West Coast style
in hip-hop that he developed from Dre’s first album continued on Doggystyle. Critics have
praised Snoop Doggy Dogg for the lyrical "realism" that he delivers on the album and
for his distinctive vocal flow. Despite some mixed criticism of the album initially upon
its release, Doggystyle earned recognition from many music critics as one of the most
significant albums of the 1990s, as well as one of the most important hip-hop albums ever
released. Much like The Chronic, the distinctive sounds of Doggystyle helped introduce
the hip-hop subgenre of g-funk to a mainstream audience, bringing forward West Coast
hip hop as a dominant force in the early-1990s. Doggystyle debuted at No. 1 on the
Billboard 200, selling 806,858 copies in its first week alone in the United States, which
was the record for a debuting artist and the fastest-selling hip-hop album ever. Doggystyle
was included on The Source magazine’s list of the 100 Best Rap Albums; as well as Rolling
Stone magazine’s list of Essential Recordings of the ’90s. About.com placed the album in
No. 17 of the greatest hip hop/rap albums of all time. The album was certified quadruple
platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). By November 2015,
the album had sold 7,000,000 copies in the United States, and over 11,000,000 copies
worldwide.
Sincerely,

FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST

Dear Darelle Kentiga,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “figging” we collected the following
information:
Figging is the practice of inserting a piece of skinned ginger root into the human anus or
the vagina in order to generate an acute burning sensation. Historically this was a method
of punishment, but has since been adopted as a pratice of BDSM. The term "figging" comes
from the 19th century word "feaguing."
Sincerely,

John Smith
FOI Manager

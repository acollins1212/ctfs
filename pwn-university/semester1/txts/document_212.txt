FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST

Dear Vikki Cahilly,
regarding your Freedom of Information request titled “bullshit” we collected the following
information:
Bullshit (also bullcrap) is a common English expletive which may be shortened to the
euphemism bull or the initialism BS. In British English, "bollocks" is a comparable expletive. It is mostly a slang profanity term meaning "nonsense", especially as a rebuke in
response to communication or actions viewed as deceptive, misleading, disingenuous, unfair or false. As with many expletives, the term can be used as an interjection, or as many
other parts of speech, and can carry a wide variety of meanings. A person who communicates nonsense on a given subject may be referred to as a "bullshit artist". While the word
is generally used in a deprecatory sense, it may imply a measure of respect for language
skills or frivolity, among various other benign usages. In philosophy, Harry Frankfurt,
among others, analyzed the concept of bullshit as related to but distinct from lying. As an
exclamation, "Bullshit!" conveys a measure of dissatisfaction with something or someone,
but this usage need not be a comment on the truth of the matter.
Sincerely,

John Smith
FOI Manager
